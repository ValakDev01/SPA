<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This React application leverages React Router to manage navigation between different pages. It features a main landing page, a product details page, a pricing information page, and a login page. If users navigate to a non-existent route, they are redirected to a "Page Not Found" page. The application ensures smooth client-side routing, enhancing user experience by allowing seamless transitions between various sections of the app.
